# Status

## Current phase

Phase 2 — Topic inspiration and landing: **complete**. Phase 3 (question
interpretation) next.

## Completed

### Phase 0 — Concept and source audit
- Master package integrated into `erwinfries-hue/takemesis` on branch
  `claude/takemesis-mvp-app-f622xx`, `docs/CLAUDE.md` mirrored to repo root.
- All 21 base documents, `.env.example`, `PACKAGE_MANIFEST.json`, and supplied
  visual references reviewed.
- `CONCEPT_REVIEW_NOTES.md`: deep audit across 10 required perspectives.
- All mandatory open decisions from `02_CONCEPT_REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md` resolved via
  one-question-at-a-time dialogue — see `DECISIONS_LOG.md` and
  `FINAL_CONCEPT_DECISIONS.md`.
- `FINAL_MVP_SCOPE.md`, `SOURCE_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
  `OPEN_RISKS.md` produced.
- Implementation approved by Erwin on 2026-07-25.

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- Next.js 16 App Router scaffold at repo root, TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS v4,
  no basePath, no AXIA4 reverse proxy.
- Brand design tokens (navy/teal/gold/warning palette per
  `13_DESIGN_SYSTEM_BRAND_AND_ASSETS.md`) in `src/app/globals.css`, with a WCAG
  AA contrast note distinguishing decorative vs. body-text-safe shades.
- Cookie-based DE/EN i18n scaffold (`src/lib/i18n/`): dictionaries, `getDictionary`,
  `getLocale`, `LocaleSwitcher` — deterministic German default (DACH market) with
  explicit user override, no Accept-Language sniffing.
- Zod-validated environment config (`src/lib/env/`), split into client
  (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, statically inlined per var) and server schemas mirroring
  `docs/.env.example`; secrets not yet provisioned stay optional until their
  consuming feature is built.
- Test harness: Vitest (unit + integration projects), Playwright + axe-core for
  e2e/accessibility (`@a11y`-tagged spec). All commands from `CLAUDE.md` wired:
  `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:integration`, `test:e2e`,
  `test:a11y`, `verify`.
- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint/typecheck/unit/integration/
  build job, plus a separate Playwright e2e/a11y job.
- `npm run verify` passes end-to-end; all 12 unit+integration tests and all 3
  Playwright specs (including the accessibility scan) pass.
- Minimal branded placeholder home page (not the final landing page — that's
  Phase 2) proves the design tokens, i18n, and layout shell work together.

### Phase 2 — Topic inspiration and landing
- `src/content/topics.ts`: all 12 categories (decision #1), localized DE/EN, each
  with description, 4–8 example questions, limitations, risk profile, and source
  route (matching `SOURCE_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`); `elevated` risk profile on
  Gesundheit & Prävention and Kinder/Erziehung (decision #2).
- Shared site chrome (`SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`) moved into the root layout;
  reusable `TopicCard`, `ExampleQuestionChip`, `OwnQuestionForm` components per
  `13_DESIGN_SYSTEM_BRAND_AND_ASSETS.md`.
- Full landing page with all 10 required sections from
  `05_UX_USER_FLOWS_AND_PAGES.md` (brand/promise, topic grid teaser, own-question
  input, example-report preview, how-it-works, free-vs-paid, source transparency,
  trust/beta, price/no-subscription, footer/legal).
- `/topics`: full category grid with all example questions, own-question form.
- `/example-report`: honest "in preparation" placeholder naming the curated topic
  (decision #3); real content is Phase 8, once source adapters exist.
- `/methodology`, `/sources` (source-routing table sourced from the same topics
  content module), `/privacy`, `/legal` (seller identity from decision #11, interim
  tax wording from decision #12), `/about`.
- Example-question chips deep-link into the own-question form with the question
  prefilled (`?q=...`) — a real, working convenience, not a simulated backend;
  no fake question-processing is implied anywhere in the UI copy.
- Playwright + axe caught and fixed 2 real WCAG AA contrast violations (teal-500/
  neutral-400 as body text) during this phase; both now documented in
  `globals.css` as decorative-only shades. Also caught and fixed a broken
  accessible-label association and a stale-state bug in `OwnQuestionForm` when
  navigating between chips on the same page.
- All 24 unit/integration tests and all 20 Playwright specs (incl. 8 a11y scans)
  pass; `npm run verify` passes end-to-end.

## Not started

Phases 3–13 from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: question interpretation, source
adapters, search/ranking/screening, eligibility engine, Stripe/report lifecycle,
premium report renderer, email/admin/analytics, hardening, preview beta,
production prep, production launch.

## Blocking item tracked for later (does not block continued implementation)

Treuhänder confirmation on Swiss MWST / EU cross-border VAT (see `OPEN_RISKS.md` #1).
Blocks live Stripe mode and real payments only — not the beta build itself.

## Next step

Phase 3: domain/risk classification (all 12 categories plus the independent
high-risk detector from decision #2), query clarification flow (confirm/edit/
alternatives), unsafe/unsupported handling — per `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
